# Asymptotic Analysis Tool

This is a mirror of https://bitbucket.org/JavaScriptBach/penguins, a 
tool that analyzes a subset of Java code and attempts to analytically 
determine the asymptotic runtime of that particular chunk of code.

See the wiki for more info: https://bitbucket.org/JavaScriptBach/penguins/wiki/Home

This was a group project for CSE 401 (compilers).
